"""
Exponential backoff helper.

This module provides a decorator and functional interface for retrying
operations with exponential backoff and jitter. It is used in the
pipeline to handle transient errors when parsing documents or calling
external services.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func:
        The function to execute. It may be synchronous and return any value.
    retries:
        The maximum number of retry attempts. A value of 0 disables
        retries entirely.
    base_delay:
        The initial delay in seconds before the first retry. Each
        subsequent retry doubles this delay (plus jitter).
    exceptions:
        A tuple of exception classes that trigger a retry. Other
        exceptions propagate immediately.
    logger:
        Optional logger to emit warning messages when retries occur.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        A function with the same signature as ``func`` that performs
        retries on failure. If all retries are exhausted the last
        exception is reâ€‘raised.
